## 1. Reading and Writing Files

### Reading Files

To process data stored in files, you'll need to read the file content into your program.

**Example: Reading a file line by line**

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Iterate over each line in the file
    for line in file:
        # Process the line
        print(line)
```

- **Note:** Using `with open()` ensures the file is properly closed after its contents have been processed.

### Writing Files

To output data or results to a file, you can write to a file using the following pattern:

**Example: Writing data to a file**

```python
# Open the file in write mode
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    # Write data to the file
    file.write('Hello, OmniCo!\n')
    file.write('Data analysis complete.')
```

---

## 2. String Manipulation

### Stripping Whitespace

When reading lines from a file, you may need to remove extra whitespace characters like newline (`\n`).

**Example: Removing trailing whitespace**

```python
line = line.strip()
```

### Splitting Strings

To break a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter (e.g., commas in a CSV file), use the `split()` method.

**Example: Splitting a comma-separated string**

```python
data = 'apple,banana,cherry'
fruits = data.split(',')  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Converting Strings to Numbers

Data read from files is often in string format. To perform calculations, convert strings to integers or floats.

**Example: Converting strings to numeric types**

```python
number_str = '42'
number_int = int(number_str)     # 42 as an integer
number_float = float(number_str)  # 42.0 as a float
```

---

## 3. Working with Data Structures

### Lists

A list is an ordered collection of items.

**Example: Creating and accessing a list**

```python
# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Access the first item
first_number = numbers[0]  # 10
```

### Dictionaries

A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.

**Example: Creating and using a dictionary**

```python
# Create a dictionary of employee IDs and names
employees = {
    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
}

# Access a value by key
employee_name = employees['E001']  # 'Alice Smith'
```

### Nested Dictionaries

Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values.

**Example: Nested dictionary**

```python
# Create a dictionary of students with their scores
students = {
    'Alice': {'math': 90, 'science': 85},
    'Bob': {'math': 75, 'science': 80},
    'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 100}
}

# Access nested values
alice_math_score = students['Alice']['math']  # 90
```

### Updating Nested Dictionaries

You can update values within a nested dictionary by specifying the keys in sequence.

**Example: Updating a nested dictionary**

```python
# Update Bob's science score
students['Bob']['science'] = 82

# Add a new subject for Charlie
students['Charlie']['english'] = 88
```

- **Note:** If the key does not exist, it will be added to the dictionary.

---

## 4. Control Flow Statements

### If Statements

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.

**Example: Basic if statement**

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print('Grade: A')
elif score >= 80:
    print('Grade: B')
else:
    print('Grade: C')
```

---

## 5. Loops and Iteration

### For Loops

Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences like lists or dictionaries.

**Example: Iterating over a list**

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Iterating Over Dictionaries

When iterating over dictionaries, you can access keys and values.

**Example: Iterating over dictionary items**

```python
employees = {
    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
}

for emp_id, name in employees.items():
    print(f'ID: {emp_id}, Name: {name}')
```

### Looping Through Nested Dictionaries and Computing Values

You can loop through a nested dictionary to perform calculations and update the dictionary.

**Example: Calculating average scores and adding them to the dictionary**

```python
# Existing nested dictionary of students and their subject scores
students = {
    'Alice': {'math': 90, 'science': 85, 'english': 88},
    'Bob': {'math': 75, 'science': 82, 'english': 79},
    'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 100, 'english': 92}
}

# Loop through each student to calculate the average score
for student, scores in students.items():
    total = sum(scores.values())
    count = len(scores)
    average = total / count
    # Add the average score back into the student's dictionary
    students[student]['average'] = average

# The students dictionary now includes the average score
print(students)
```

**Output:**

```python
{
    'Alice': {'math': 90, 'science': 85, 'english': 88, 'average': 87.66666666666667},
    'Bob': {'math': 75, 'science': 82, 'english': 79, 'average': 78.66666666666667},
    'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 100, 'english': 92, 'average': 95.66666666666667}
}
```

- **Explanation:** We used a loop to calculate the average score for each student and added a new key-value pair `'average': average` to their nested dictionary.

## 6. Performing Calculations

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

You can perform arithmetic operations using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

**Example: Calculating an average**

```python
total = 250
count = 5
average = total / count  # 50.0
```

### Avoiding Division by Zero

Always ensure the denominator is not zero before dividing.

**Example: Safe division**

```python
if count != 0:
    average = total / count
else:
    average = 0  # Handle the zero division case appropriately
```

---

## 7. Formatting and Printing Output

### Using the Print Function

Display information using the `print()` function.

**Example: Printing a message**

```python
print('Welcome to OmniCo!')
```

### String Formatting

Format strings to include variables and control numeric precision.

**Example: Using f-strings**

```python
name = 'Alice'
score = 92.567

print(f'{name} scored {score:.2f} points.')  # 'Alice scored 92.57 points.'
```

- `:.2f` formats the number to two decimal places.

---

## 8. Error Handling

### Handling Exceptions

Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle potential errors.

**Example: Handling ValueError**

```python
value = 'abc'

try:
    number = int(value)
except ValueError:
    print('Cannot convert to integer.')
```

---

## 9. Best Practices

### Writing Readable Code

- Use meaningful variable names.
- Keep code organized and properly indented.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

### Commenting Your Code

- Add comments to explain non-obvious parts of your code.
- Keep comments concise and relevant.

**Example:**

```python
# Calculate the average score
average_score = total_score / number_of_scores
```

### Following Style Guidelines

- Use consistent naming conventions (`snake_case` for variables and functions).
- Avoid overly long lines; keep them under 80 characters when possible.
- Separate code into logical sections with blank lines.

---

## Additional Tips

- **Testing Your Code:** Regularly test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.
- **Debugging:** Use print statements or a debugger to trace and fix issues.
- **Asking for Help:** If you're stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to a peer or mentor.
