## 1. Reading and Writing Files

### Reading Files

To process data stored in files, you'll need to read the file content into your program.

**Example: Reading a file line by line**

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Iterate over each line in the file
    for line in file:
        # Process the line
        print(line)
```

- **Note:** Using `with open()` ensures the file is properly closed after its contents have been processed.

### Skipping Header Rows

When reading CSV files, you might need to skip the header row.

**Example: Skipping the header**

```python
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Read the header line
    header = file.readline()
    # Process the remaining lines
    for line in file:
        # Process the line
        print(line)
```

### Writing Files

To output data or results to a file, you can write to a file using the following pattern:

**Example: Writing data to a file**

```python
# Open the file in write mode
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    # Write data to the file
    file.write('Hello, OmniCo!\n')
    file.write('Data analysis complete.')
```

---

## 2. String Manipulation

### Stripping Whitespace

When reading lines from a file, you may need to remove extra whitespace characters like newline (`\n`).

**Example: Removing trailing whitespace**

```python
line = line.strip()
```

### Splitting Strings

To break a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter (e.g., commas in a CSV file), use the `split()` method.

**Example: Splitting a comma-separated string**

```python
data = 'apple,banana,cherry'
fruits = data.split(',')  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Converting Strings to Numbers

Data read from files is often in string format. To perform calculations, convert strings to integers or floats.

**Example: Converting strings to numeric types**

```python
number_str = '42'
number_int = int(number_str)      # 42 as an integer
number_float = float(number_str)  # 42.0 as a float
```

---

## 3. Working with Data Structures

### Lists

A list is an ordered collection of items.

**Example: Creating and accessing a list**

```python
# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Access the first item
first_number = numbers[0]  # 10
```

### Dictionaries

A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.

**Example: Creating and using a dictionary**

```python
# Create a dictionary of employee IDs and names
employees = {
    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
}

# Access a value by key
employee_name = employees['E001']  # 'Alice Smith'
```

### Nested Dictionaries

Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values.

**Example: Nested dictionary**

```python
# Create a dictionary of students with their scores
students = {
    'Alice': {'math': 90, 'science': 85},
    'Bob': {'math': 75, 'science': 80},
    'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 100}
}

# Access nested values
alice_math_score = students['Alice']['math']  # 90
```

### Updating Nested Dictionaries

You can update values within a nested dictionary by specifying the keys in sequence.

**Example: Updating a nested dictionary**

```python
# Update Bob's science score
students['Bob']['science'] = 82

# Add a new subject for Charlie
students['Charlie']['english'] = 88
```

- **Note:** If the key does not exist, it will be added to the dictionary.

### Extracting Keys and Values as Lists

You can extract all the keys or values from a dictionary and convert them into a list.

**Example: Getting a list of keys**

```python
# Given a dictionary of users
user_data = {
    'U001': {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
    'U002': {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},
    'U003': {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}
}

# Get a list of user IDs
user_ids = list(user_data.keys())  # ['U001', 'U002', 'U003']
```

---

## 4. Control Flow Statements

### If Statements

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.

**Example: Basic if statement**

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print('Grade: A')
elif score >= 80:
    print('Grade: B')
else:
    print('Grade: C')
```

---

## 5. Loops and Iteration

### For Loops

Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences like lists or dictionaries.

**Example: Iterating over a list**

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Iterating Over Dictionaries

When iterating over dictionaries, you can access keys and values.

**Example: Iterating over dictionary items**

```python
employees = {
    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
}

for emp_id, name in employees.items():
    print(f'ID: {emp_id}, Name: {name}')
```

### Looping Through Nested Dictionaries and Computing Values

You can loop through a nested dictionary to perform calculations and update the dictionary.

**Example: Calculating average scores and adding them to the dictionary**

```python
# Existing nested dictionary of students and their subject scores
students = {
    'Alice': {'math': 90, 'science': 85, 'english': 88},
    'Bob': {'math': 75, 'science': 82, 'english': 79},
    'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 100, 'english': 92}
}

# Loop through each student to calculate the average score
for student, scores in students.items():
    total = sum(scores.values())
    count = len(scores)
    average = total / count
    # Add the average score back into the student's dictionary
    students[student]['average'] = average

# The students dictionary now includes the average score
print(students)
```

**Output:**

```python
{
    'Alice': {'math': 90, 'science': 85, 'english': 88, 'average': 87.66666666666667},
    'Bob': {'math': 75, 'science': 82, 'english': 79, 'average': 78.66666666666667},
    'Charlie': {'math': 95, 'science': 100, 'english': 92, 'average': 95.66666666666667}
}
```

- **Explanation:** We used a loop to calculate the average score for each student and added a new key-value pair `'average': average` to their nested dictionary.

### While Loops

Use `while` loops to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

**Example: Using a while loop**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f'Count is {count}')
    count += 1
```

### Using Break Statements

The `break` statement exits the nearest enclosing loop.

**Example: Exiting a loop early**

```python
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5
    print(number)
```

---

## 6. Performing Calculations

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

You can perform arithmetic operations using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

**Example: Calculating an average**

```python
total = 250
count = 5
average = total / count  # 50.0
```

### Using min() and max() Functions

The `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest of the input values, respectively.

**Example: Limiting a value to a maximum**

```python
increase = 50
max_increase = 30
adjusted_increase = min(increase, max_increase)  # adjusted_increase is 30
```

**Example: Ensuring a value is at least a minimum**

```python
score = 45
min_score = 50
adjusted_score = max(score, min_score)  # adjusted_score is 50
```

### Distributing Values with Constraints

When distributing a total amount among multiple items with individual limits, you may need to:

- **Calculate Equal Distribution**

  ```python
  total_amount = 100
  num_items = 5
  equal_share = total_amount / num_items  # 20.0
  ```

- **Apply Individual Limits Using min()**

  ```python
  for item in items:
      max_allowable = item['max_limit']
      item_increase = min(equal_share, max_allowable)
      item['value'] += item_increase
  ```

- **Handle Remaining Amounts**

  ```python
  remaining_amount = total_amount - sum_of_distributed_amounts
  while remaining_amount > 0:
      for item in items:
          if remaining_amount <= 0:
              break
          additional_increase = min(item['max_limit'] - item['value'], remaining_amount)
          item['value'] += additional_increase
          remaining_amount -= additional_increase
  ```

### Calculating Percentage Increases

**Example: Calculating the percentage increase**

```python
original_value = 80
new_value = 100
increase = new_value - original_value
percentage_increase = (increase / original_value) * 100  # 25.0%
```

### Avoiding Division by Zero

Always ensure the denominator is not zero before dividing.

**Example: Safe division**

```python
if count != 0:
    average = total / count
else:
    average = 0  # Handle the zero division case appropriately
```

### Casting Values During Calculations

When performing calculations that result in float values, you may need to cast them to integers.

**Example: Converting a float to an integer**

```python
value = 23.75
integer_value = int(value)  # 23
```

- **Note:** Casting to `int` truncates the decimal part.

---

## 7. Formatting and Printing Output

### Using the Print Function

Display information using the `print()` function.

**Example: Printing a message**

```python
print('Welcome to OmniCo!')
```

### String Formatting

Format strings to include variables and control numeric precision.

**Example: Using f-strings**

```python
name = 'Alice'
score = 92.567

print(f'{name} scored {score:.2f} points.')  # 'Alice scored 92.57 points.'
```

- `:.2f` formats the number to two decimal places.

### Formatting Strings for Files

When writing formatted data to a file, you can use f-strings and special characters like `\n` (newline) and `\t` (tab).

**Example: Writing formatted text to a file**

```python
with open('report.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('User Report\n')
    file.write('-----------\n')
    file.write('UserID\tName\t\tScore\n')
    for user_id, data in user_data.items():
        line = f"{user_id}\t{data['name']}\t{data['score']}\n"
        file.write(line)
```

### Aligning Text Output

You can use formatting options to align text and numbers.

**Example: Formatting with alignment**

```python
# Left-align text and format numbers with precision
line = f"{user_id:<5}{data['name']:<15}{data['score']:>5.2f}\n"
```

- `<` : Left-align within the available space.
- `>` : Right-align within the available space.
- `.2f` : Format the number with two decimal places.

---

## 8. Error Handling

### Handling Exceptions

Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle potential errors.

**Example: Handling ValueError**

```python
value = 'abc'

try:
    number = int(value)
except ValueError:
    print('Cannot convert to integer.')
```

---

## 9. Best Practices

### Writing Readable Code

- Use meaningful variable names.
- Keep code organized and properly indented.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

### Commenting Your Code

- Add comments to explain non-obvious parts of your code.
- Keep comments concise and relevant.

**Example:**

```python
# Calculate the average score
average_score = total_score / number_of_scores
```

#### Commenting Complex Logic

When implementing complex algorithms or logic, add comments to explain the steps.

**Example: Explaining a distribution algorithm**

```python
# First pass: Distribute the equal share to each user without exceeding the maximum increase
for user_id in user_ids:
    # Calculate the maximum allowable increase for this user
    max_increase = user_data[user_id]['OriginalInteractions'] * 0.25
    # Determine the increase (minimum of equal share or max allowable)
    increase = min(equal_share, max_increase)
    # Update the user's interactions
    user_data[user_id]['Interactions'] += int(increase)
    # Subtract the allocated increase from the remaining amount
    remaining_increase -= increase
```

### Following Style Guidelines

- Use consistent naming conventions (`snake_case` for variables and functions).
- Avoid overly long lines; keep them under 80 characters when possible.
- Separate code into logical sections with blank lines.
